## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `access_token` | GitHub Access Token for authentication | Yes | - |
| `coverage_file` | Path to the coverage file (e.g., coverage.xml, coverage.json) | Yes | `coverage.xml` |
| `api_base` | CodeAnt AI API base URL | No | `https://api.codeant.ai` |
| `platform` | Git platform (github, gitlab, bitbucket) | No | `github` |
| `base_url` | Base URL of the git platform | No | `https://github.com` |
| `module` | Module name for monorepo setups (optional) | No | `''` |
| `module_path` | Module path for resolving files in monorepo (e.g., services/backend, defaults to module if not provided) | No | `''` |

## Supported Coverage Formats

- Cobertura XML (`.xml`)
- JaCoCo XML
- LCOV (`.lcov`)
- JSON coverage reports
- And more...

## Setup

### 1. Generate Coverage Report

First, ensure your test suite generates a coverage report. Here are examples for common languages:

#### Python (pytest)
```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=xml
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest)
```bash
jest --coverage --coverageReporters=cobertura
```

#### Java (Maven)
```bash
mvn test jacoco:report
```

#### Go
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml
```

### 2. Add Secrets

Add your CodeAnt AI access token to your repository secrets:
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `ACCESS_TOKEN_GITHUB`
5. Value: Your CodeAnt AI access token

### 3. Configure Workflow

Add the action to your GitHub Actions workflow as shown in the usage examples above.

## How It Works

1. The action fetches the latest coverage upload script from CodeAnt AI
2. Decodes and prepares the script for execution
3. Uploads your coverage report along with commit and branch information
4. CodeAnt AI processes the report and provides analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Coverage file not found
Ensure the `coverage_file` path is correct and the file exists before running this action.

### Authentication failed
Verify that your `ACCESS_TOKEN_GITHUB` is valid and has the necessary permissions.

### Script execution failed
Check that the CodeAnt AI API is accessible from your runner environment.
